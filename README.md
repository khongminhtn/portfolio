# Portfolio Website 
 
This repository contains the source code of my React application, using the knowledge that I have obtained from studying Helsinki Full Stack course. 

My portfolio displays my freelance work, website concepts and personal projects. Alongside this, it will also be showing the planning and thinking process of both design and development. 
 
The portfolio will be ongoing work. It will be updated, improved and revised regularly to reflect my knowledge and experience.
